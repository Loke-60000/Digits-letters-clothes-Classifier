# Convolutional Neural Network

This repository contains a convolutional neural network trained on the MNIST dataset using Keras.

## Dataset

The MNIST dataset is a collection of handwritten digits. It consists of 70,000 images, each of size 28x28 pixels. The dataset is directly compatible with the original MNIST dataset.

## API for Digit and Letter Recognition

This repository also includes an API for predicting digits and letters using the trained models. The API is built using FastAPI and TensorFlow.

### API usage

1. Install the required dependencies by running the following command:

```
cd api
```

```
python api.py
```
